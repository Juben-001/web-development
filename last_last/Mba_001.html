</div>________________________
    <P>I am Mohammed Ben Abdallah, an 18 year old pursing his dreams i.e : to become a biomedical engineer. Being a blend of medicine and engineering, biomedical engineers have the ability to create health equipment that can make healthcare better and more easily accessible. I recently discoved this course, my dad wanted me to offer medicine and i wanted to do an engineering course with biomedical engineering being sandwitched between them, it was an intersection for us to settle on. So far I don't have any regrets choosing it as my course the tutors deliver their absolute best with zero nepotism, my favourite subjects so far are Algebra, Applied Electricity and Basic Mechanics with my zeal for mathematics it was obvious I would love them. Procrastination is what is killing me here but I know I'll overcome it Insha Allah.
